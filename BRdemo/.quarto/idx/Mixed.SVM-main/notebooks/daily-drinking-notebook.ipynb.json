This tracks if the individual used alcohol, nicotine, cannabis, or other drugs. The results in this notebook correspond to the results in the manuscript. \n\nPlease see the daily-drinking-notebook-demo for a notebook you can interactively run on simulated data. \n\n***\n\n\n\nAbove we loaded the daily drinking and drug use data:\n\n\n| Variable | Description | Coding |\n| :--------| :--------- |   ------|\n| ursi | Individual ID |        |\n| male | Male | 1=male;2=female | \n| age | Age in years | \n| Day | Day | |\n| SD | Standard drinks consumed | \n| AD | Did drinking take place? | 1=yes;0=no |\n| HD | Did heavy drinking take place? | 1=yes;0=no |\n| MD | Did moderate drinking take place? | 1=yes;0=no |\n| NICUSEDAY | Any nicotine use (cigarettes, e-cigs, smokekess, etc) | 1=yes;0=no |\n| THCUSEDAY | Any use of THC | 1=yes;0=no |\n| OTHERDRUGUSE | Any use of any other drugs | 1=yes;0=no |\n\n\n\nWe want to learn the alcohol drinking patterns in this data. In other words, we want to fit a model of heavy drinking (`HD`) considering demographics (`age`, `male`) and additional variables that may change over time and influence risk of heavy drinking, including other substances (nicotine, cannabis, and other drugs; `NICUSEDAY`, `THCUSEDAY`, and `OTHERDRUGUSE`, respectively). \n\n\n***\n\n\n## Model\n\nThe Mixed.SVM is described in detail in the Methodology section of the manuscript.\n\nThe analysis requires several R libraries. We'll go ahead and install and load these now.\n\nNext we source the algorithm code as well as tools to help summarize the results.\n\nThe arguments of Mixed.SVM are the following\n\n| Argument | Description | Setting |\n| -------- | ----------- | --------- | \n| Y | Response vector encoded 0 and 1 | `HD` |\n| X | Design matrix corresponding to Y | `male`, `age`, `NICUSEDAY`, `THCUSEDAY`, `OTHERDRUGUSE` |\n| T | Vector of times at which the observations in Y were taken | `Day` |\n| U | Vector which indentifies the user IDs for the observations in `Y`, `X`, and `T` | `ursi` |\n| Tmax | Maximum time to be included in the analysis | 720 |\n| knot.seq | Interior knot set for subject specific trajectories | 0.5 | \n| Iter | Number of MCMC iterations | 100000 |\n| burn.in | Number of MCMC iterations to discard | 50000\n\nWe set these parameters for modeling:\n\nNext we call the Mixed.SVM algorithm or load in a previous run. \n\n***\n\n## Results\n\n\n### Daily drinking summaries\n\nFirst we summarize daily drinking for the input dataset:\n\n| Variable | Description |\n| -------- | ----------- |\n| pdd | Proportion drinking days |\n| phdd | Proportion heavy drinking days |\n| ddd | Average standard drinks per drinking day |\n| dpd | Average standard drinks per day |\n| totaldays | total days |\n| totaldrinkdays | total number of drinking days |\n| totalheavydays | total number of heavy drinking days | \n| phwd | Proportion heavy drinking days while drinking | \n| mxd | maximum standard drinks|\n\nAt the baseline assessment in this study, the participants are interviewed and a detailed log of daily drinking is created for the previous 3 months (90 days). So we start summarizing drinking on day 90. Day 181 corresponds to three month after baseline, day 364 for the nine month visit, and day 637 for the eighteen month visit. For these four visits, we'll summarize these variables for the previous month (30 days).\n\nThese are easily adjustable for your study, see `time` and `visitdays` below. The `log.summaries` function generates individual level summaries for the the variables described above. `includevisitday` indicates if the visit day should be included in the summary or not.\n\nWe summarize drinking over the participants in the study by computing the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and number of missing observations for one month of drinking logs at baseline, 3 month, 9 months, and 18 months.\n\nLet's take a look at the individual trends in heavy drinking over the duration of the study. \n\nThe individuals in this study on average drank heavily 25-30% of the past 30 days before each assessment. However, each individual has their own drinking pattern that typical summaries would not capture. \n\n### Mixed-SVM results\nThe `Mixed.SVM` algorithm takes some time to run 100K iterations. We have loaded the results of a previous run so we can look at the results.\n\n#### Classification Rate\n\nThe classification rate is the number of times the model correctly predicts a heavy drinking day out of 109,580 observations (190 individuals) in the ABQ DrinQ data. The model classifies 84% of heavy drinking days correctly. \n\n#### Performance Metrics\n\nHere we compute a summary of the performance of the `Mixed-SVM` algorithm in predicting heavy drinking days. This includes the rate of true positives (TP or sensitivity), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN or specificity), and false negatives (FN). \n\nIn the ABQ DrinQ study, the model predicts 54% of the days with heavy drinking and 95% of days without heavy drinking correctly. The false positive rate is 5% and the false negative rate is 46%. The model's performance may be improved with the consideration of additional regularly measured predictors (e.g., stress).  \n\n#### Parameter Summary\n\nOverall among heavy drinkers, we find that age (younger), gender (female), and using nicotine, cannabis, and other drugs are associated with increase risk of heavy drinking episodes. A variable is statistically significant when the 95% credible intervals do not contain zero. \n\n#### Report of subject specific heavy drinking risk\n\nNext we look at the estimated risk trajectories for each study participant. Since there are many trajectories and the user may want to quickly examine the entire cohort, we include some code to layout the graphs 6 per page. For space, we only display the graphs for the first 18 participants.\n\nEach graph is labeled with the de-identified participant id. The risk of heavy drinking is charted by days that individual is followed in the study up to `Tmax`. Values above zero indicate increased risk of heavy drinking and values below zero indicate decreased risk of heavy drinking. The influence of using or discontinuing use of other substances (e.g, tobacco) can be seen by jumps in risk.\n\nThe user may look closely at an individual's estimated risk of heavy drinking trajectory over time. The function Ind.trajectory.pretty takes in the subject indentifier and the results of SVM.Mixed and presents the estimated heavy drinking trajectories for four individuals in the ABQ DrinQ data (`87198709`, `87178393`, `87195831`, and `8718920`). Each point is the value of the linear predictor for that given day. The further the values are away from zero, the more or less likely at individualis going to have a heavy drinking day. These values are color coded by the 8 combinations of the 3 time varying covariates (nicotine, cannabis (THC), and other drug use).\n\n* Patient `87198709` is alternating between cannabis use and smoking.  The risk  of  heavy  drinking  is  greatly  increased  when  the  subject smokes  tobacco  (upper  curve).  In  general,  this  patient  reduced  their  heavy drinking during the beginning of the study. \n\n* Patient `87178393` uses cannabis regularly and smokes tobacco or uses other drugs occasionally (dots of elevated risk). As seen, the risk of heavy drinking greatly increases when using other substances. \n\n* Patient `87195831` uses cannabis and smokes tobacco regularly. Initially the patientâ€™s risk of heavy drinking decreased but then increased  again  after  day  200  in  the  study  with  more  regular  use  of tobacco. Near the end of followup, the patient started using other drugs, a red flag. \n\n* Patient `87189209` was a regular tobacco smoker and then stopped smoking around Day 90 (near their baseline assessment). Their risk of heavy drinking continued to decline, which is encouraging.\n\n#### Significance of the individual specific random trajectories\nWe now look at the same individuals' random trajectories and corresponding 95% credible bands. If the bands exclude zero, the random effects are significant for that individual. \n\nThe random effects are significant for these patients.  `87198709` is less likely to have a heavy drinking day after Day 100. `87178393` is at risk of heavy drinking throughout the study. `87195831` is least likely to participate in heavy drinking between Days 100 and 200. There is a \"good\" pattern change in drinking behavior for `87189209` after Day 75.   \n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis notebook takes daily substance use logs and learns patterns of use.
